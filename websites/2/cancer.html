<p><b><font color="#0066CC"><a name="A:_What_is_cancer">A:</a></font><a name="A:_What_is_cancer"> What is cancer?</a></b> Cancer is a group of many related 
diseases that begin in cells, the body’s basic building blocks. To understand 
cancer, it is helpful to know what happens when normal cells become cancerous. </p>
<p>The body is made up of many types of cells. Normally, cells grow and divide 
to produce more cells as they are needed to keep the body healthy. Sometimes, 
this orderly process goes wrong. New cells form when the body does not need 
them, and old cells do not die when they should. The extra cells form a mass of 
tissue called a growth or tumor. Not all tumors are cancerous; tumors can be 
benign or malignant. </p>
<p>Benign tumors are not cancer. They can often be removed and, in most cases, 
they do not come back. Cells in benign tumors do not spread to other parts of 
the body. Most important, benign tumors are rarely a threat to life. </p>
<p>Malignant tumors are cancer. Cells in malignant tumors are abnormal and 
divide without control or order. Cancer cells invade and destroy the tissue 
around them. Cancer cells can also break away from a malignant tumor and enter 
the bloodstream or lymphatic system. </p>
<p>Blood vessels include a network of arteries, capillaries, and veins through 
which the blood circulates in the body. The lymphatic system carries lymph and 
white blood cells through lymphatic vessels (thin tubes) to all the tissues of 
the body. By moving through the bloodstream or lymphatic system, cancer can 
spread from the primary (original) cancer site to form new tumors in other 
organs. The spread of cancer is called metastasis.</p>

<p><b><font color="#0066CC"><a name="A:_How_can_one_get_cancer">A:</a></font><a name="A:_How_can_one_get_cancer"> How 
do people get cancer?</a> </b>Scientists have learned that cancer is caused by changes in genes that 
normally control the growth and death of cells. Certain lifestyle and 
environmental factors can change some normal genes into genes that allow the 
growth of cancer. Many gene changes that lead to cancer are the result of 
tobacco use,
diet, exposure to ultraviolet (UV)
radiation from the sun, or exposure to
carcinogens (cancer-causing substances) in the workplace or in the 
environment. Some gene
alterations are inherited (from one or both parents). However, having an 
inherited gene alteration does not always mean that the person will develop 
cancer; it only means that the chance of getting cancer is increased. Scientists 
continue to examine the factors that may increase or decrease a person’s chance 
of developing cancer. </p>
<p>Although being infected with certain
viruses, such as the
human papillomavirus (HPV),
hepatitis B and
<a class="definition" title="Click to see definition." onclick="javascript:popWindow('definition','hepatitis C virus&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English');  return(false);" blank href="http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?term=hepatitis C virus&version=Patient&language=English">
C</a> (HepB and HepC), and
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 
increases the risk of some types of cancer, cancer itself is not contagious. A 
person cannot catch cancer from someone who has this disease. Scientists also 
know that an injury or bruise does not cause cancer.</p>

<p><b><font color="#0066CC"><a name="A:_How_can_we_prevent_cancer">A:</a></font><a name="A:_How_can_we_prevent_cancer"> How 
can cancer be prevented?</a></b> Although there is no 
guaranteed way to prevent cancer, people can reduce their risk (chance) of 
developing cancer by:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>not using tobacco products </li>
<li>choosing foods with less fat and eating more vegetables, fruits, and 
whole grains </li>
<li>exercising regularly and maintaining a lean weight </li>
<li>avoiding the harmful rays of the sun, using
sunscreen, and wearing clothing that protects the skin </li>
<li>talking with a doctor about the possible benefits of
drugs proven to reduce the risk of certain cancers </li>
</ul>
<p>Although many
risk factors can be avoided, some, such as inherited conditions, are 
unavoidable. Still, it is helpful to be aware of them. It is also important to 
keep in mind that not everyone with a particular risk factor for cancer actually 
gets the disease; in fact, most do not. People who have an increased likelihood 
of developing cancer can help protect themselves by avoiding risk factors (see 
Question 2) whenever possible and by getting regular checkups so that, if cancer 
develops, it is likely to be found and treated early. Treatment is often more 
effective when cancer is detected early. Screening exams, such as
sigmoidoscopy or the
fecal occult blood test,
mammography, and the
Pap test, can detect precancerous conditions (which can be treated before 
they turn into cancer) and early-stage cancer.</p>

<p><b> <font color="#0066CC"><a name="A:_What_do_I_do_if_I_have_cancer">A:</a></font><a name="A:_What_do_I_do_if_I_have_cancer"> 
How do I Know if I have cancer?</a></b> Cancer can cause a 
variety of symptoms. Possible signs of cancer include the following:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>new thickening or lump in the breast or any other part of the body </li>
<li>new
mole or an obvious change in the appearance of an existing
wart or mole </li>
<li>a sore that does not heal </li>
<li>nagging cough or hoarseness </li>
<li>changes in
bowel or
bladder habits </li>
<li>persistent indigestion or difficulty swallowing </li>
<li>unexplained changes in weight </li>
<li>unusual bleeding or discharge </li>
</ul>
<p>When these or other symptoms occur, they are <strong>not </strong>always 
caused by cancer. They can be caused by
infections, benign tumors, or other problems. It is important to see a 
doctor about any of these symptoms or about other physical changes. Only a 
doctor can make a diagnosis. A person with these or other symptoms should
<strong>not </strong>wait to feel pain because early cancer usually does not 
cause pain. </p>
<p>If symptoms occur, the doctor may perform a
physical examination, order blood work and other tests, and/or recommend a
biopsy. In most cases, a biopsy is the only way to know for certain whether 
cancer is present. During a biopsy, the doctor removes a sample of tissue from 
the abnormal area. A
pathologist studies the tissue under a microscope to identify cancer cells.</p>
